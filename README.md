# Dissertation-Code

This repository contains the code and most data used to generate the results in my PhD dissertation, available here:
https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd2023/380/

The repository consists of two directories: one for each major project covered in the dissertation. Both directories are organized in a cleaning and analysis pipeline format integrating input data, code, and results in discrete steps. The scripts contained in each sub-folder typically assume all previous steps in the pipeline have been executed. Details are provided in the heading of each script. The pipeline is designed to work as a unit and assumes users retain the provided directory structure. Each script begins with a line of code that sets the working directory to the source file location. Users should update this line of code based on the file's location on their machine. All other file paths in the scripts are relative paths to maximize directory portability.

Additional documentation is available in Appendix C of the dissertation.
